An issue with the current design of the elevator is the user must press 2 buttons to go up or down one floor. The user must first push the button to either go up one floor or down one floor, then once inside must again press the button for the floor. With an elevator that only has 2 floors this seems redundant. This design follows the design of every elevator but could be streamlined and improved to make it easier for the user. 

# Getting B: 

Common Uses: Go from one floor to another, avoid the stairs
Rare Uses: in an emergency

Sequence of Actions: 
Press button, doors open, taken to your floor.
Buttons inside: open or close doors, alarm, and help; these are for use when needed

Support & Feedback:
Support – drawings/images/symbols to show floor level number
Feedback – elevator makes a noise to let the user know it has arrived, when it moves up/down past a floor (changes number count too), when arrive on floor and doors open

Common Mistakes:
Common mistakes are forgetting to press the button for the floor when you enter the elevator, pressing the wrong button and going to the wrong floor

Improvements: 
To improve this elevator I suggest removing the buttons from inside (except the emergency buttons). If user is on floor 2, then they will push the down button; if they are on floor 1 they push the up button. They will then have 20-40 seconds to get inside the elevator, the doors will close and they will be taken up or down.
